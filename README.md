# SARA (Substance Abuse Research Assistant)
SARA is a novel app to engage users with ongoing tracking using timely rewards thereby reinforcing users for data input. SARA is
developed for adolescents and emerging adults at risk for substance abuse. The rewards in SARA are designed to be developmentally and culturally appropriate to the target demographic and are
theoretically grounded in the behavioral science literature. In this paper, we describe SARA and its rewards to increase data collection. We also briefly
discuss future plans to evaluate SARA and develop just in time adaptive interventions for engagement and behavior change.
