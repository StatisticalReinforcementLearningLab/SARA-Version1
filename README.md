# SARA
SARA (Substance Abuse Research Assistant)

## Project Description
SARA is a novel app to engage users with ongoing tracking using timely rewards thereby reinforcing users for data input. SARA is developed for adolescents and emerging adults at risk for substance abuse. The rewards in SARA are designed to be developmentally and culturally appropriate to the target demographic. For more details please check out the following paper or contact mrabbi@fas.harvard.edu

The code is divided into two folder. One folder contains the SARA mobile app code. The other folder contain the code to analyze the causal effect of the SARA app. If you want to cite our work then you can use the following two links:

## Code Description 
The code for SARA is divided into two folder. The individual folders contain readme files that describe how the individual folder codes work. 

* [App_code](/Analysis_code): App code folder contains the code for the SARA mobile app. 
* [Analysis_code](/Analysis_code): Contains code and description of time-varying causal effects of treatment with a binary outcome.
