# SARA
SARA (Substance Abuse Research Assistant)

## Project Description
SARA is a novel app to engage users with ongoing tracking using timely rewards thereby reinforcing users for data input. SARA is developed for adolescents and emerging adults at risk for substance abuse. The rewards in SARA are designed to be developmentally and culturally appropriate to the target demographic. For more details please check out the following paper or contact mrabbi@fas.harvard.edu

The code is divided into two folder. One folder contains the SARA mobile app code. The other folder contain the code to analyze the causal effect of the SARA app. If you want to cite our work then you can use the following two links:

The goal of this project is to do. 


## Code Description ##

If there are steps to run the code list them as follows: 

0. Dependencies. If there are any dependencies list them. 
1. Get the data
* Where is the data, who is in charge of it, how do they get it. 
* Are there preprocessing steps? If so what folder are they in, for example: [the data preprocessing directory](/data_preprocessing)
2. Run methods. Point people towards the folder with methods. [the methods directory](/methods)
3. Evaluate. Point people towards the folder with evaluation functions [the evaluation directory](/evaluation)

SOMETHING TO NOTE: Readmes are incredibly sensitive to spaces, if you are not sure why something isn't working double check the example and make sure you have the spacing right. 

Here is an example code block:

```
mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=classpath.out
```
